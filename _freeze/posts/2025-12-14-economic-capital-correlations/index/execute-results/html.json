Yet many models still rely on undocumented rules of thumb. This post compares publicly disclosed correlation structures from major frameworks and shows how sensitive a simple P&C capital stack is to those choices.\n\n## Reference points from regulation and rating agencies\n\n### Solvency II standard formula (non-life focus)\n\nThe European Union's Solvency II standard formula aggregates risk modules using a correlation matrix derived from observed co-movements across undertakings. At the market risk sub-module level, the Delegated Regulation specifies the following representative correlations (rows/columns ordered: interest-rate, equity, spread, property, currency):\n\n|               | Interest | Equity | Spread | Property | Currency |\n|---------------|---------:|-------:|-------:|---------:|---------:|\n| **Interest**  | 1.00     | 0.25   | 0.50   | 0.25     | 0.25     |\n| **Equity**    | 0.25     | 1.00   | 0.75   | 0.50     | 0.25     |\n| **Spread**    | 0.50     | 0.75   | 1.00   | 0.50     | 0.25     |\n| **Property**  | 0.25     | 0.50   | 0.50   | 1.00     | 0.25     |\n| **Currency**  | 0.25     | 0.25   | 0.25   | 0.25     | 1.00     |\n\nFor non-life underwriting, the standard formula uses two key drivers: premium/reserve risk and catastrophe risk. The correlation between them is set at 0.50. Counterparty default (type 1/2) enters the basic solvency capital requirement (BSCR) with a 0.25 correlation against both market and non-life modules, reflecting partial diversification.\n\n### S&P Insurance Capital Model (2024 criteria)\n\nS&P's publicly available criteria outline a square-root aggregation with stronger co-movement between credit and market risk than in Solvency II, and moderately positive correlation between insurance and financial risks. A stylized extract of the published covariance assumptions for a P&C carrier is:\n\n|               | Underwriting | Credit | Market |\n|---------------|-------------:|-------:|-------:|\n| **Underwriting** | 1.00 | 0.50 | 0.25 |\n| **Credit**       | 0.50 | 1.00 | 0.75 |\n| **Market**       | 0.25 | 0.75 | 1.00 |\n\nHere, \"underwriting\" combines premium and reserve risk; \"credit\" covers reinsurance and investment counterparties; and \"market\" blends equity and interest-rate exposures.\n\n### AM Best BCAR (2024 methodology)\n\nBCAR disclosures show diversification limited mainly to interactions among underwriting, reserve, and credit components. Market risk is often treated with minimal diversification against underwriting. A simplified covariance view consistent with BCAR's published covariance charge is:\n\n|               | Premium & Reserve | Credit | Market |\n|---------------|-----------------:|-------:|-------:|\n| **Premium & Reserve** | 1.00 | 0.50 | 0.00 |\n| **Credit**            | 0.50 | 1.00 | 0.00 |\n| **Market**            | 0.00 | 0.00 | 1.00 |\n\nThe relatively low diversification means higher total required capital for the same standalone risk profile compared with Solvency II or S&P.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis in a simple P&C stack\n\nTo see how correlation drives results, consider a stylized company with the following standalone 99.5% VaR capital (in arbitrary units):\n\n- Underwriting (premium & reserve): 250\n- Catastrophe: 150\n- Credit (reinsurance + investments): 120\n- Equity market risk: 180\n- Interest-rate risk (fixed income): 90\n\nThe code below aggregates capital using a square-root formula under three matrices: Solvency II-inspired, S&P-like, and BCAR-like. It also shocks the overall off-diagonal correlations ±10% to illustrate model sensitivity.\n\n::: {#9543a883 .cell execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Framework</th>\n      <th>Base capital</th>\n      <th>+10% rho</th>\n      <th>-10% rho</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Solvency II style</td>\n      <td>544.0</td>\n      <td>558.1</td>\n      <td>529.4</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>S&amp;P style</td>\n      <td>582.1</td>\n      <td>598.9</td>\n      <td>564.7</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>BCAR style</td>\n      <td>483.2</td>\n      <td>492.8</td>\n      <td>473.4</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe outputs show how diversification assumptions dominate total required capital.\n\n## Takeaways for practitioners\n\n- **Anchor to an external benchmark.** Solvency II provides a transparent starting point; adjust the equity–credit and underwriting–credit correlations if your asset mix or reinsurance program differs materially from the European average.\n- **Reflect business mix.** A reinsurer with heavy catastrophe exposure might justify a higher correlation between underwriting and equity (due to CAT bonds or retrocession linked to financial markets) than a personal lines carrier.\n- **Document rationale and periodic back-testing.** Revisit correlations annually with empirical checks (e.g., rolling correlations of combined ratios vs. credit spreads/equity indices) and explain deviations from published frameworks to governance bodies.\n- **Stress diversification.** Regulators and rating agencies often review sensitivity to higher correlations. Including ±10% shocks, as above, in your internal capital adequacy assessment will pre-empt questions about model risk.\n\n",
