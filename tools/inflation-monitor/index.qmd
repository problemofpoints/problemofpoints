### About this dashboard

- **Data source:** Bureau of Labor Statistics (CPI-U, seasonally adjusted) accessed live through the BLS Public Data API.  
- **Categories:** Focus on property & casualty exposures—auto insurance, vehicle repairs, construction-sensitive goods (durables, tools & hardware), shelter/energy inputs, and medical cost drivers (mix of seasonally adjusted headline CPI and not-seasonally-adjusted component series).  
- **Metrics:** Switch between the price index level, year-over-year change, or month-over-month change to highlight different dynamics.  
- **Workflow tips:** Use the “Select core exposures” shortcut for a quick P&C view, or enable every category, then export snapshots via your browser’s print-to-PDF functionality.
