## About This Tool

The dashboard pulls the latest preliminary storm reports from the NOAA Storm Prediction Center (SPC) using a Netlify Function proxy. Report locations are plotted on an interactive Leaflet base layer so you can drill into tornado, severe wind, and large hail footprints for any day. A companion Netlify Function summarizes every tornado report since 2000 to benchmark the current season against last year and the broader historical distribution.
