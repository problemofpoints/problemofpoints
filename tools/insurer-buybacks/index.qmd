### About this tool

- **Data source:** Live fundamentals pulled through a Netlify function that queries Yahoo Finance. Tangible book is approximated with stated book value when balance sheet detail is unavailable.
- **Payback logic:** Implied return equals ROE divided by the price-to-tangible book multiple; the Rule of 72 converts that return into a dilution payback period.
- **Red-zone tiers:** Default required return hurdles mirror IBNR Weekly #36 (2025) groupings — 7–10%, 10–12%, 12–14%, and 14%+. Adjust the sliders to test custom assumptions.
- **Interpretation:** Use the classification badges to quickly identify companies where incremental buybacks risk eroding long-term tangible book value compounding.
