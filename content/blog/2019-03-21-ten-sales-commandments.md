A set of rules written in the 1950s by former Goldman Sachs co-chair John Whitehead for the new "new business" / sales department (now Investment Banking Services).

- Don't waste your time going after business we don't really want.
- The boss usually decides - not the assistant treasurer. Do you know him?
- It's just as easy to get a first-rate piece of business as a second-rate one.
- You can never learn anything when you're talking.
- The respect of one man is worth more than acquaintance with 100.
- When there's business to be done, get it!
- Important people like to deal with other important people. Are you one?
- There's nothing worse than an unhappy client.
- If you get the business, it's up to you to see that it's well handled.
