# Summary

[2018 Allianz Risk Barometer](http://www.agcs.allianz.com/assets/PDFs/Reports/Allianz_Risk_Barometer_2018_EN.pdf)

Top 3 global risks:

**1. Business interruption (incl. supply chain disruption):** top risk for the sixth consecutive year with 42% of responses rating it in the top three risks. As businesses move from being rich in physical assets to intangibles and services, BI is being triggered by non-traditional risk exposures which donâ€™t cause physical damage but result in lost income.

**2. Cyber incidents:** 54% of respondents think cyber incidents are currently the most underestimated risk

**3. Natural catastrophes:** Approximately $335bn in overall losses from natural catastrophes in 2017. Around $135bn in insured losses.
