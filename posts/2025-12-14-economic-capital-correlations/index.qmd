Robust diversification assumptions can change a property & casualty (P&C) economic capital estimate by double-digit percentages. Yet many models still rely on undocumented rules of thumb. This post compares publicly disclosed correlation structures from major frameworks and shows how sensitive a simple P&C capital stack is to those choices.

## Reference points from regulation and rating agencies

### Solvency II standard formula (non-life focus)

The European Union's Solvency II standard formula aggregates risk modules using a correlation matrix derived from observed co-movements across undertakings. At the market risk sub-module level, the Delegated Regulation specifies the following representative correlations (rows/columns ordered: interest-rate, equity, spread, property, currency):

|               | Interest | Equity | Spread | Property | Currency |
|---------------|---------:|-------:|-------:|---------:|---------:|
| **Interest**  | 1.00     | 0.25   | 0.50   | 0.25     | 0.25     |
| **Equity**    | 0.25     | 1.00   | 0.75   | 0.50     | 0.25     |
| **Spread**    | 0.50     | 0.75   | 1.00   | 0.50     | 0.25     |
| **Property**  | 0.25     | 0.50   | 0.50   | 1.00     | 0.25     |
| **Currency**  | 0.25     | 0.25   | 0.25   | 0.25     | 1.00     |

For non-life underwriting, the standard formula uses two key drivers: premium/reserve risk and catastrophe risk. The correlation between them is set at 0.50. Counterparty default (type 1/2) enters the basic solvency capital requirement (BSCR) with a 0.25 correlation against both market and non-life modules, reflecting partial diversification.

### S&P Insurance Capital Model (2024 criteria)

S&P's publicly available criteria outline a square-root aggregation with stronger co-movement between credit and market risk than in Solvency II, and moderately positive correlation between insurance and financial risks. A stylized extract of the published covariance assumptions for a P&C carrier is:

|               | Underwriting | Credit | Market |
|---------------|-------------:|-------:|-------:|
| **Underwriting** | 1.00 | 0.50 | 0.25 |
| **Credit**       | 0.50 | 1.00 | 0.75 |
| **Market**       | 0.25 | 0.75 | 1.00 |

Here, "underwriting" combines premium and reserve risk; "credit" covers reinsurance and investment counterparties; and "market" blends equity and interest-rate exposures.

### AM Best BCAR (2024 methodology)

BCAR disclosures show diversification limited mainly to interactions among underwriting, reserve, and credit components. Market risk is often treated with minimal diversification against underwriting. A simplified covariance view consistent with BCAR's published covariance charge is:

|               | Premium & Reserve | Credit | Market |
|---------------|-----------------:|-------:|-------:|
| **Premium & Reserve** | 1.00 | 0.50 | 0.00 |
| **Credit**            | 0.50 | 1.00 | 0.00 |
| **Market**            | 0.00 | 0.00 | 1.00 |

The relatively low diversification means higher total required capital for the same standalone risk profile compared with Solvency II or S&P.

## Sensitivity analysis in a simple P&C stack

To see how correlation drives results, consider a stylized company with the following standalone 99.5% VaR capital (in arbitrary units):

- Underwriting (premium & reserve): 250
- Catastrophe: 150
- Credit (reinsurance + investments): 120
- Equity market risk: 180
- Interest-rate risk (fixed income): 90

The code below aggregates capital using a square-root formula under three matrices: Solvency II-inspired, S&P-like, and BCAR-like. It also shocks the overall off-diagonal correlations ±10% to illustrate model sensitivity.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Standalone capital vector
risks = ["UW", "Cat", "Credit", "Equity", "IR"]
capital = pd.Series([250, 150, 120, 180, 90], index=risks)

# Helper: aggregate capital via square-root formula

def aggregate(capital, corr):
    v = np.asarray(capital)
    c = np.asarray(corr)
    return float(np.sqrt(v @ c @ v))

# Correlation assumptions (symmetric, rows/cols follow 'risks')
solvency_corr = pd.DataFrame(
    [
        [1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25],   # UW vs others
        [0.5, 1.0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25],   # Cat vs others
        [0.25, 0.25, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5],    # Credit vs others (closer to spread risk)
        [0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 0.25],   # Equity vs others
        [0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.25, 1.0],   # IR vs others
    ],
    index=risks,
    columns=risks,
)

sp_corr = pd.DataFrame(
    [
        [1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25],
        [0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25],
        [0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.75, 0.5],
        [0.25, 0.25, 0.75, 1.0, 0.5],
        [0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0],
    ],
    index=risks,
    columns=risks,
)

bcar_corr = pd.DataFrame(
    [
        [1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0],
        [0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0],
        [0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
        [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.25],
        [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0],
    ],
    index=risks,
    columns=risks,
)

scenarios = {
    "Solvency II style": solvency_corr,
    "S&P style": sp_corr,
    "BCAR style": bcar_corr,
}

records = []
for name, corr in scenarios.items():
    base = aggregate(capital, corr)
    # uniformly scale off-diagonal correlations up/down by 10% (capped to [-1,1])
    off_diag = corr.values.copy()
    np.fill_diagonal(off_diag, 0)
    shocked_up = corr.values + 0.1 * off_diag
    shocked_down = corr.values - 0.1 * off_diag
    np.fill_diagonal(shocked_up, 1)
    np.fill_diagonal(shocked_down, 1)
    records.append(
        {
            "Framework": name,
            "Base capital": round(base, 1),
            "+10% rho": round(aggregate(capital, shocked_up), 1),
            "-10% rho": round(aggregate(capital, shocked_down), 1),
        }
    )

pd.DataFrame.from_records(records)
```

The outputs show how diversification assumptions dominate total required capital.

## Takeaways for practitioners

- **Anchor to an external benchmark.** Solvency II provides a transparent starting point; adjust the equity–credit and underwriting–credit correlations if your asset mix or reinsurance program differs materially from the European average.
- **Reflect business mix.** A reinsurer with heavy catastrophe exposure might justify a higher correlation between underwriting and equity (due to CAT bonds or retrocession linked to financial markets) than a personal lines carrier.
- **Document rationale and periodic back-testing.** Revisit correlations annually with empirical checks (e.g., rolling correlations of combined ratios vs. credit spreads/equity indices) and explain deviations from published frameworks to governance bodies.
- **Stress diversification.** Regulators and rating agencies often review sensitivity to higher correlations. Including ±10% shocks, as above, in your internal capital adequacy assessment will pre-empt questions about model risk.
