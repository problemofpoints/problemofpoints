## Why the latest simulation craft matters

Property & casualty (P&C) carriers rely on multi-horizon market scenarios to stress solvency ratios, price
reinsurance, and respond to ORSA review cycles. Over the last two years, advances in high-frequency
factor data, Bayesian filtering, and generative models have shifted best practice away from “scaled
historicals” toward richer, governance-friendly pipelines. This post inventories the 2025 playbook for
simulating equity total returns and sovereign or credit yield curves/returns, with an eye on regulatory
transparency, reproducibility, and computational efficiency.

We assume you already have a capital framework that translates market shocks into balance-sheet
impacts. The focus here is the upstream scenario engine.

## Data management first

1. **Granular but reconciled histories**: daily equity and rate panels should reconcile to the general
   ledger and market data tapes (ICE, Bloomberg B-PIPE, Refinitiv). Use immutable Bronze/Silver/Gold
   zones or data vault patterns so auditors can reproduce runs.
2. **Point-in-time fundamentals & macro**: incorporate restated fundamentals, macro forecasts, and
   climate stress narratives. Scenario conditioning is increasingly requested in NAIC and EIOPA
   examinations.
3. **Forward-looking overlays**: consensus analyst targets, option-implied distributions, and liquidity
   haircuts provide forward guidance when pure time-series methods under-react to regime shifts.
4. **Metadata capture**: track every resampling seed, calibration window, and code revision. A simple
   combination of `dvc`, `git`, and a metadata table inside your risk data mart is sufficient for audit.

## Equity return engines

### 1. Block bootstrap variants

* **Stationary bootstrap / circular bootstrap**: captures volatility clustering without overstating
  persistence. Ideal when your historical window already contains multiple shocks (e.g., 2020, 2022,
  2024). Implement using `arch.bootstrap.StationaryBootstrap` or
  `arch.bootstrap.CircularBlockBootstrap` from the [`arch` project](https://github.com/bashtage/arch),
  which combines Cython/Numba performance with standard econometric diagnostics.
* **Conditional scenarios**: re-weight blocks using macro regimes (inflation, unemployment) to mirror
  climate or inflation stresses. Store regime weights alongside run metadata for auditability.

### 2. Factor and cross-sectionally aware models

* **Dynamic factor models (DFM)**: combine equity excess returns, macro surprises, and liquidity spreads.
  Estimate with Kalman filtering (`statsmodels.tsa.statespace.DynamicFactorMQ`) and propagate uncertainty
  through simulation draws.
* **Partial equilibrium macro-factor overlays**: line up capital market assumptions (CMAs) from your CIO
  desk with factor shocks using shrinkage (`sklearn.covariance.LedoitWolf`) to stabilize covariance
  estimates on medium-sized universes.
* **Riskfolio workflows**: the open-source [Riskfolio-Lib](https://github.com/dcajasn/Riskfolio-Lib)
  package supports scenario resampling, Black-Litterman posterior generation, and downside risk metrics
  that map neatly into economic capital frameworks.

### 3. Volatility and higher-moment dynamics

* **GARCH/EGARCH/FIGARCH families**: calibrate to sector or regional buckets, then simulate conditional
  vol paths. `arch.univariate` covers the full suite; mix in `arch.multivariate` DCC models when you need
  co-volatility dynamics.
* **Stochastic volatility (SV) models**: Heston, SABR, and rough volatility processes capture volatility
  smiles embedded in option markets. `QuantLib` bindings via `QuantLib-SWIG` expose Monte Carlo pricers,
  Fourier inversion tools, and calibration helpers suitable for daily scenario refreshes.
* **Jump diffusion & variance-gamma**: integrate observed jump intensities from limit-order-book data.
  Use `sympy.stats` for symbolic sanity checks and `numpyro`/`PyMC` for Bayesian posterior draws.

### 4. Regime-switching and hidden Markov structures

* **Markov-switching VAR/GARCH**: `statsmodels.tsa.regime_switching` fits Hamilton-style switches that
  distinguish high-volatility drawdown regimes from calm periods.
* **Macro-conditioned hidden semi-Markov**: extend dwell-time distributions beyond geometric using
  `hsmmlearn` (community package) or bespoke Pyro/PyMC code. Particularly useful for modeling prolonged
  inflationary regimes.

### 5. Generative AI accelerators

* **Diffusion models for return paths**: research-grade pipelines (e.g., _Diffusion Models for Financial
  Time Series_, arXiv:2406.07812) generate entire paths conditioned on initial states and macro features.
  Practical implementations leverage `torch`, `diffusers`, and time-series embeddings such as
  `tsdiffusion`.
* **Variational autoencoders (VAEs)**: pair with copula-based dependence reconstruction to retain tail
  structure. Libraries like `pytorch-forecasting` and `sktime-dl` provide templates.
* **Generative reinforcement learning**: use `tf-agents` or `rlax` to learn stress paths that maximize
  solvency impact subject to plausibility constraints.

## Dependence modeling across asset classes

* **Dynamic copulas**: `pyvinecopulib` delivers vine copulas with time-varying parameters and rich tail
  asymmetry controls—ideal when equity-bond correlations flip signs.
* **Graphical factor copulas**: calibrate sparse precision matrices with `skggm` or `quic` to obtain
  explainable dependency networks.
* **DCC/GOGARCH**: rely on `arch.multivariate` or `mgarch` to model conditional correlations and feed
  them into both equity and rates engines.

## Yield curve and fixed-income return engines

### 1. Cross-sectional curve construction

* **Overnight index swap (OIS) bootstrapping**: implement multi-curve bootstraps with `QuantLib`. Modern
  builds (see the [QuantLib-SWIG README](https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib-SWIG)) expose curve
  bootstrap helpers for SOFR, €STR, and TONAR.
* **Smooth parametric families**: Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS) remains the regulatory workhorse. Use the
  `YieldCurve` or `pynss` packages to fit NSS, or rely on `scikit-curve` wrappers for cross-validation.
* **Smith-Wilson and extrapolation**: necessary for Solvency II long-end requirements. Community libraries
  like `smithwilson` (PyPI) enforce monotonicity and convergence to the Ultimate Forward Rate (UFR).
* **Monotone convex splines**: `scipy.interpolate.PchipInterpolator` or `pycubicspline` maintain no-arb
  conditions when building callable bond curves.

### 2. Dynamic term-structure models (TSMs)

* **Affine models (Hull-White, LGM, CIR++)**: calibrate to swaption cubes using `QuantLib`, then simulate
  yield paths via short-rate Monte Carlo.
* **Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) and LIBOR market models (LMM)**: use `QuantLib` or specialized libraries
  such as `rateslib` (supports multi-curve HJM/LMM with trade valuation) to evolve entire curves under
  forward measures.
* **Dynamic Nelson-Siegel (DNS)**: employ state-space formulations with Kalman filtering—`statsmodels` and
  `pydlm` handle DNS with stochastic volatility. Kalman-smoothing residuals become inputs for scenario
  generation.
* **Macro-consistent term-structure**: integrate shadow-rate or macro-finance models (e.g., Adrian
  Crump Moench) via Bayesian platforms (`PyMC`, `numpyro`) to align with central-bank narratives.

### 3. Credit and spread processes

* **Reduced-form hazard models**: calibrate Poisson intensities to CDS curves using `QuantLib` and update
  via particle filters (`particles` library) to reflect macro shocks.
* **Structural / distance-to-default overlays**: couple equity simulations with balance-sheet dynamics
  using `merton`-style models implemented in `risk-neutral` or `mibian`.
* **Liquidity and roll-down effects**: embed bid-ask dynamics using `alphalens`/`zipline-reloaded`
  analytics or custom microstructure adjustments for illiquid municipal books.

## Scenario design for economic capital

1. **Horizon mapping**: align scenario steps with regulatory horizons (1-day, 10-day, 1-year). Use nested
   Monte Carlo only when valuation is strongly path dependent.
2. **Tail amplification**: apply filtered historical simulation (FHS) or extreme value theory (EVT) with
   `scipy.stats.genpareto` fits to fatten tails before injecting into net asset value (NAV) calculations.
3. **Balance-sheet feedback**: overlay dynamic hedging rules and reinsurance recoveries; ensure
   reproducible business-rule code via `nbdev` or well-tested modules.
4. **Governance artifacts**: produce calibration books that version-control data sources, seeds, and
   modeling assumptions. Export to PDF/Quarto for ORSA appendices.

## Practical tips for P&C insurers

* **Align with actuarial cash-flow models**: ensure market scenarios feed directly into projected claim
  payouts, cat reinsurance layers, and ALM analytics. Document mapping tables.
* **Version-controlled narratives**: store scenario rationales (e.g., “inflationary stagnation”) next to
  code. Regulators increasingly request the qualitative story during onsite reviews.
* **Hardware acceleration**: GPU-enabled diffusion/GAN models run 10–30× faster on modest RTX cards.
  Containerize with `docker` plus `nvidia-container-toolkit` and orchestrate via `prefect` or `dagster`.
* **Model risk management (MRM)**: maintain independent challenger models—e.g., pure historical
  bootstraps vs. diffusion-based scenarios—and compare tail percentiles quarterly.

## Putting it into production

Build a reference implementation that stitches together the pieces:

1. **Calibration notebooks** (Quarto/Jupyter) to estimate equity and rate model parameters.
2. **Reusable simulation modules** packaged with `poetry` or `uv`. Aim for deterministic builds via
   lockfiles.
3. **Scenario store** in object storage (e.g., S3) with Parquet outputs tagged by scenario ID, version,
   and calibration timestamp.
4. **Continuous validation**: nightly coverage tests on summary statistics, K-S distances, and economic
   capital outputs. Alert when drifts exceed pre-approved bands.

With these building blocks, your economic capital engine can span the breadth of 2025 market volatility
without sacrificing transparency—or burning the actuarial team with ad hoc reconciliations.
